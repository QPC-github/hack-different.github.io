# Hack Different

Hack Different is a community built around all jailbreaks, reverse engineering and security for Apple products.  It
was created by the core [checkra1n](https://checkra.in) team but is owned by the community (in part due to `checkm8`
being a useful tool for research for years to come).

### Rules

Writing out some rules:

0. Use common sense and behave yourself.
0. No "drama" (i.e. arguments that do not seek a solution).
0. This is NOT a jailbreak support server. Do not ask for customer support here.
0. This should be obvious, but no dealing with illegal material here.
0. Do not ask for ETA.
0. Do not ask for iCloud lock bypass.
0. If an admin or mod asks you to change your behaviour, don't make them ask twice.

Violations may result in either a polite warning, a kick, or a ban at the team's discretion
