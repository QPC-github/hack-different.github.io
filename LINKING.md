3. Ensure you press "authorize" to allow discord to read your public GitHub profile.  You might need your U2F/Webauthn
   password to complete this process

## Why is linking valuable

When this is complete you will have your public GitHub username visible to anyone who views your Discord profile. We
can also use this to link roles in discord to the teams in GitHub to reduce friction fo the moderator team.
